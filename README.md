## Check Your Understanding - Responses
1. No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. Unit Testing should be utilized on a small scale without many moving parts, yet a messaging feature for a messaging application has a multitude of moving parts and interactions between users such that unit tests would not suffice. It simply cannot test how the components themselves interact with each other.
2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. This feature is simply one that prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters. Using unit tests can be done quickly and wouldn't affect the non-related unit tests. There are not a bunch of moving parts, but rather is just unit tests a simple and straightforward feature.
